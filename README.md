Text to Speech (TTS): This is the process of converting written text into spoken words. A TTS system takes text as input and produces synthesized speech as output.
Speech to Text (STT): This process involves converting spoken language into written text. An STT system takes speech audio as input and produces transcribed text as output.
Video to Audio: This step involves extracting the audio track from a video file. It removes the visual component and retains only the sound.
Audio to Text (ASR): This is similar to STT but operates on audio files instead of live speech. It involves converting recorded audio into written text.
